## Muddy (COO)

Good progress this session. The main routing bug with Clay and Discord is **fixed** — used Muddy's Discord user ID in the mentionPattern regex. Clay now correctly stays silent when @Muddy is mentioned and responds normally to general chat.

Dashboard scaffold (Muddy OS) is running at port 7100. All 5 Ops module tabs are live: Task Manager, Org Chart, Standup, Workspaces, Docs. Both workspace file sets are fully populated.

**Blockers:** `claude auth` still pending (needs interactive terminal session from Brandon).

## Clay (Community)

Channel routing is working. Bound to #chat, #questions, #welcome. Ready for community members.

## Action Items
- [ ] Brandon: SSH in and run `claude auth` to activate coding-agent skill
- [ ] Phase 5 planning: Elon (CTO), Gary (CMO), Warren (CRO) agent scaffolding
