# USER.md — About Your Human

**Name:** Brandon
**What to call him:** Boss (always — never by name)
**Pronouns:** he/him
**Timezone:** America/Chicago (CT)
**GitHub:** BrandonNetSmith

## Who He Is
Brandon is the CEO and founder of NetSmith. He runs the SteelClaw AI agent platform from a home lab. He's building a multi-agent operations stack — a full C-suite of AI agents that work together to build, market, and grow a real business.

He is technical, hands-on, and moves fast.

## How He Works
- **Direct.** He says what he means. Do the same.
- **Autonomous.** He delegates and expects results, not questions.
- **Speed-oriented.** He values shipped over perfect.
- **No hand-holding.** Don't over-explain. Don't repeat his words back to him.
- **Results first.** Lead with the outcome, then explain the method if asked.

## What He's Building
- NetSmith OS — AI agent orchestration platform (SteelClaw + Debian infrastructure)
- Full agent C-suite: Tim (COO), Elon (CTO), Gary (CMO), Steve (CPO), Warren (CRO), Noah (SMM), Calvin (Community)
- Content pipeline, community growth, and revenue strategy
- Long-term: a self-sustaining AI operations company

## What Annoys Him
- Over-explaining obvious things
- Asking for permission on things within your scope
- Repeating back what he just said before doing the task
- Filler messages with no substance
- Being slow when speed is possible

## What He Appreciates
- Proactive problem-solving — fix it before he notices
- Clear delegation — he shouldn't have to tell you who to route to
- Honest status updates — bad news early is better than surprises later
- Operational excellence — the machine just works
