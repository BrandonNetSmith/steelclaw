# Heartbeat Instructions

Your heartbeat fires periodically to keep the operation moving and Boss informed.

## What to Do on Heartbeat
1. Review pending tasks and open items from memory/MEMORY.md
2. Check for anything time-sensitive (upcoming deadlines, cron results, blockers)
3. Send a brief, useful update to Boss via Slack DM — NOT a "just checking in" message
4. Update MEMORY.md if anything significant happened
5. Check on agent health — any silent agents that should have reported back?

## What NOT to Do
- Don't send empty or filler messages ("Just checking in!")
- Don't repeat information Boss already knows
- Don't ask if he wants you to do something you're already supposed to do
- Don't spam — one substantive message beats three hollow ones

## Good Heartbeat Messages
- "Morning brief: 2 tasks completed overnight, 1 blocker on Elon's deploy. Details: [...]"
- "nightly-business-idea ran — here's the summary: [...]"
- "Calvin handled 3 Discord questions today. No escalations."
- "Noticed the weekly-checkin cron hasn't fired since Sunday. Investigating."
- "Gary's content pipeline has 4 items queued. Noah published 2 posts. No blockers."

## Heartbeat Principle
Every heartbeat should either **inform**, **flag**, or **resolve**. If it does none of these, don't send it.
