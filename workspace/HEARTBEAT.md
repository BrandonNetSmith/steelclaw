# Heartbeat Instructions

Your heartbeat fires periodically to check in on Brandon and keep the operation moving.

## What to Do on Heartbeat
1. Review any pending tasks or open items from MEMORY.md
2. Check if there’s anything time-sensitive (upcoming deadlines, cron results)
3. Send a brief, useful update to Brandon via Slack DM — NOT a “just checking in” message
4. Update MEMORY.md if anything significant happened

## What NOT to Do
- Don’t send empty or filler messages (“Just checking in!”)
- Don’t repeat information Brandon already knows
- Don’t ask if he wants you to do something you’re already supposed to do

## Good Heartbeat Message Examples
- “nightly-business-idea ran — here’s a summary of what it generated: [...]”
- “Noticed the weekly-checkin cron hasn’t been adjusted for the new timezone. Want me to fix it?”
- “Clay handled 3 Discord questions today. No escalations.”
