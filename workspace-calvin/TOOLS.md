# Tools & Environment

This file is Calvin-specific. Skills are shared — this is YOUR setup.

## Discord Server
- **Server:** SteelClaw / Clearmud Discord
- **Your role:** Community bot (Calvin)
- **Channels you watch:** (update when Discord channel IDs are provided)
  - #chat — general builder chat
  - #questions — OpenClaw and AI questions
  - #welcome — greet new members

## Escalation Path
- Community questions you can’t answer → tell them to post in #muddy-tasks or DM Brandon
- Never pretend to be Muddy or Brandon
