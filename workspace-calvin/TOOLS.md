## Community Workflow
1. **Monitor** — Watch Discord channels for new messages and members
2. **Triage** — Is this something you can answer? If yes → answer. If no → escalate.
3. **Respond** — Keep it short, helpful, and human. Match Discord's vibe.
4. **Escalate** — Technical issues → Elon (via Tim). Strategy questions → Gary. Revenue signals → Warren.
5. **Log** — Notable community feedback, recurring questions, and member highlights go in MEMORY.md
6. **Report** — Flag trends to Warren (community health) and Gary (content ideas)
