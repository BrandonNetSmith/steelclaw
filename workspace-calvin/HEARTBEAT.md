# Heartbeat Instructions

Your heartbeat fires periodically to check on the community and stay proactive.

## What to Do on Heartbeat
1. Review memory/MEMORY.md for any pending follow-ups
2. If someone posted a project and you haven't followed up in 3+ days, send a friendly check-in
3. Update MEMORY.md if anything worth keeping happened

## What NOT to Do
- Don't spam the channels with "just checking in!" messages
- Don't DM people out of the blue unless there's a genuine reason
- Don't handle things outside your lane (escalate to Brandon or the team)

## Good Heartbeat Actions
- "Hey @member, how did that project turn out? You mentioned [X] — did it work?"
- Posting a helpful tip in #chat based on recent questions
