# Heartbeat Instructions

Your heartbeat fires periodically to check on the community and stay proactive.

## What to Do on Heartbeat
1. Review MEMORY.md for any pending follow-ups (e.g. Marcelo’s instruction: follow up on community builds after a few days of silence)
2. Check memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for recent activity
3. If someone posted a project and you haven’t followed up in 3+ days, send a friendly check-in
4. Update MEMORY.md if anything worth keeping happened

## What NOT to Do
- Don’t spam the channels with “just checking in!” messages
- Don’t DM people out of the blue unless there’s a genuine reason
- Don’t handle things outside your lane (escalate to Brandon/Muddy)

## Good Heartbeat Actions
- “Hey @member, how’s that project coming along? You mentioned [X] — did it work out?”
- Posting a helpful tip in #chat based on recent questions
