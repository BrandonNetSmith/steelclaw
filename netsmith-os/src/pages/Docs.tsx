NetSmithOS is the operational dashboard and control center for SteelClaw's AI agent infrastructure. It provides a unified interface for managing, monitoring, and coordinating multiple AI agents working together as a virtual executive team.

## Key Features

- **Task Manager**: Monitor active sessions, model usage, token consumption, and costs across all agents
- **Organization Chart**: Visualize the agent hierarchy and team structure
- **Executive Standups**: Coordinate meetings between agents and review transcripts
- **Workspaces**: Browse and edit agent configuration files
- **Documentation**: Reference guides for all system components

## Architecture

NetSmithOS runs as a local web application that reads directly from the filesystem and OpenClaw configuration files. There's no backend database — everything operates on your existing agent infrastructure.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with dark mode and phosphor emerald accents
- **Data**: Direct filesystem reads from workspace directories
- **Deployment**: systemd user service on port 7100

## Getting Started

1. The dashboard auto-loads at \`http://localhost:7100\`
2. Navigate using the left sidebar modules (🚀 Ops, 🧠 Brain, 🧪 Lab)
3. Use the top navigation within each module to access different features
4. Settings gear at bottom for configuration

## Stats Overview

The top stats row shows key metrics:
- **Active Sessions**: Currently running agent conversations
- **Idle Sessions**: Paused or waiting sessions
- **Total Sessions**: Lifetime session count
- **Tokens Used**: Aggregate token consumption
- **Total Cost**: Estimated API costs

## Model Fleet

Each configured model appears as a card showing:
- Model name and purpose
- Authentication method
- Active/Inactive status
- Cost per 1M tokens
- Token usage and session count

## Active Sessions

Live view of currently running sessions:
- Agent name
- Model being used
- Time since last activity
- Token count for session

## Auto-Refresh

Data refreshes automatically every 30 seconds. The last refresh timestamp is shown at the bottom of the page.`

Visualize the agent team hierarchy and status.

## Team Structure

The org chart shows the reporting structure:
- **CEO**: Brandon (Human) — Ultimate authority
- **COO**: Tim — Operations lead, reports to CEO
- **C-Suite**: Future executives (CTO, CMO, CRO)
- **Staff**: Direct reports like Calvin (Community)

## Agent Cards

Each agent card displays:
- Avatar and name
- Role (CEO, COO, etc.) and title
- Model powering the agent (if AI)
- Status badge

## Status Types

- **Active**: Agent is operational and in use
- **Scaffolded**: Structure defined, not yet activated
- **Future**: Planned but not yet created
- **Deprecated**: No longer in active use

## Navigation

- Click on any agent with reports to expand/collapse
- Use "Expand All" / "Collapse All" buttons for quick navigation
- Legend at bottom explains status colors`

Browse and edit agent workspace files.

## Agent Workspaces

Each agent has a dedicated workspace directory:
- **Tim**: \`~/steelclaw/workspace/\`
- **Calvin**: \`~/steelclaw/workspace-calvin/\`

## Core Files

Standard workspace files include:
- **AGENTS.md**: Agent behavior guidelines
- **SOUL.md**: Personality and identity
- **USER.md**: Information about the human
- **IDENTITY.md**: Agent's self-conception
- **TOOLS.md**: Local tool configuration
- **MEMORY.md**: Long-term memory (main session only)
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: Periodic task checklist

## File Operations

- **Preview**: Rendered markdown with syntax highlighting
- **Edit**: Raw text editor with save functionality
- Changes save directly to the filesystem

## Security Note

MEMORY.md should only be loaded in main sessions (direct chats with the human) to prevent private context from leaking to shared contexts.`

    content: `# Sub-Agents & Spawning

Understanding how agents spawn and coordinate.

## What are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are isolated sessions spawned by a parent agent to handle specific tasks. They:
- Run independently with their own context
- Can use different models than the parent
- Report back when complete
- Clean up automatically

## Spawning Methods

### sessions_spawn
\`\`\`typescript
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Research competitor pricing",
  runtime: "subagent",
  mode: "run",  // one-shot
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
})
\`\`\`

### Persistent Sessions
\`\`\`typescript
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Monitor inbox",
  runtime: "subagent", 
  mode: "session",  // persistent
  thread: true
})
\`\`\`

## Monitoring

Use the \`subagents\` tool to:
- **list**: See active sub-agents
- **steer**: Send guidance to running agents
- **kill**: Terminate a sub-agent

## Best Practices

- Use sub-agents for isolated, parallelizable work
- Choose appropriate models (fast for simple tasks)
- Set reasonable timeouts
- Let completion notifications come to you (push-based)`

    title: 'Gateway vs Sub-Agents',
    content: `# Gateway vs Sub-Agents

Understanding the difference between scheduling approaches.

## Cron Jobs (Gateway)

Use cron when:
- **Exact timing matters** ("9:00 AM every Monday")
- **Task needs isolation** from main session history
- **Different model/thinking** level needed
- **One-shot reminders** ("remind me in 20 minutes")
- **Direct channel delivery** without main session

### Example
\`\`\`typescript
cron({
  action: "add",
  job: {
    schedule: { kind: "cron", expr: "0 9 * * 1" },
    payload: { kind: "agentTurn", message: "Weekly report" },
    sessionTarget: "isolated"
  }
})
\`\`\`

## Heartbeats (Main Session)

Use heartbeats when:
- **Multiple checks can batch** (inbox + calendar + notifications)
- **Conversational context** needed from recent messages
- **Timing can drift** (every ~30 min is fine)
- **Reducing API calls** by combining periodic checks

### HEARTBEAT.md
Keep a small checklist of periodic tasks. The agent runs through them on each heartbeat poll.

## Hybrid Approach

- Batch similar periodic checks into HEARTBEAT.md
- Use cron for precise schedules and standalone tasks
- Track check timestamps in \`memory/heartbeat-state.json\``

    content: `# Voice Standup

Running executive standups with voice output.

## Overview

The Standup feature allows you to:
- Review past meeting transcripts
- Start new standup meetings
- Get voice-narrated summaries (when TTS is configured)

## Starting a Standup

1. Click "+ New Standup"
2. Enter a topic or agenda
3. The system prompts each agent for updates
4. Transcript is saved to \`~/steelclaw/workspace/standups/\`

## Voice Output

If the \`sag\` (ElevenLabs TTS) tool is available:
- Standups can be narrated aloud
- Each agent uses their configured voice
- Great for "storytime" summaries

## Transcript Format

Standups follow a standard format:
- **Attendees**: Who's present
- **Updates**: Yesterday / Today / Blockers per agent
- **Action Items**: Tasks assigned
- **Next Meeting**: Scheduled follow-up`

2. **Outreach**: Initial contact and introduction
3. **Discovery**: Understanding mutual fit
4. **Proposal**: Formal partnership terms
5. **Negotiation**: Finalizing details
6. **Closed**: Partnership active

## Tracking

Partnerships can be tracked in:
- Dedicated \`partnerships.md\` file
- CRM integration (when configured)
- Standup updates from relevant agents

## Agent Roles

- **CMO (Gary)**: Marketing partnerships, co-marketing
- **CRO (Warren)**: Revenue partnerships, sales channels
- **COO (Tim)**: Operational partnerships, integrations

How agents maintain continuity across sessions.

## The Problem

AI agents wake up fresh each session with no inherent memory. Files provide the persistence layer.

## Memory Types

### Daily Notes
\`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\`

Raw logs of what happened each day:
- Decisions made
- Tasks completed
- Important conversations
- Context worth preserving

### Long-Term Memory
\`MEMORY.md\`

Curated, distilled knowledge:
- Significant events
- Lessons learned
- Preferences discovered
- Relationships and context

## Memory Flow

1. **During sessions**: Capture important info in daily notes
2. **Periodically**: Review daily notes, update MEMORY.md
3. **Each session**: Load MEMORY.md (main session only)
4. **Over time**: Prune outdated info from MEMORY.md

## Security

- MEMORY.md contains personal context
- Only loaded in main sessions (direct chats)
- NOT loaded in shared contexts (Discord, groups)
- Prevents private info from leaking

## Best Practice

> "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.

When you want to remember something, **write it down**. Update the relevant file immediately.`
