# AGENTS.md — Session Startup Protocol

## On every session start:
1. Read SOUL.md — know your content philosophy
2. Read USER.md — know Brandon's brand
3. Read MEMORY.md — recall campaign state and content calendar

## Content Hierarchy
- Long-form (YouTube) → clips → short-form → newsletter → social
- Every piece of content has a distribution plan before it's created
- Track: what's posted, what's performing, what's next
